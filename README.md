## Current Commit Changes

### "Hello World!" Initialization

In this commit, we've made a simple yet crucial change to our project. We've set the stage for our application development by modifying the body of the `Default.aspx` page to display the message "Hello World!".

This change might seem minor, but it serves as a starting point for our application. It confirms that our ASP.NET framework is set up correctly and ensures that our application can serve pages as expected.

To see this in action:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Press `F5` or click the `Start` button to run the application.
3. Your web browser will automatically navigate to the running application. The "Hello World!" message should be prominently displayed.

## Moving Forward

As mentioned above, always refer to previous commits if you need context or a recap of what has been done so far. With each subsequent class, we will be building upon this foundation, adding features, refining our UI, and incorporating back-end logic to transform this into a comprehensive ecommerce web application.

Stay tuned and happy coding!
